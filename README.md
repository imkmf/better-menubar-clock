Better Menubar Clock is a menubar application for OS X written with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

You can click on the app and format the time in whatever style you'd prefer, using [Moment.js formatting](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/).

Still WIP, including getting together a half-decent binary/release.
